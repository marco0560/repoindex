# Embedding Performance Execution

## Purpose

This branch-local ledger records the executed steps for the batched embedding
performance workstream.

## Branch

The implementation branch for this work is:

```text
feat/batch-embedding-indexing
```

## Planned Phases

1. Branch bootstrap and execution ledger
2. ADR for batched embeddings and tunable runtime controls
3. Batched embedding backend implementation
4. Same-run payload deduplication in index persistence
5. Benchmark script and operator documentation
6. Validation, tuning review, and commit preparation

## Executed Steps

* [x] Created the dedicated implementation branch.
* [x] Added the branch-local execution ledger.
* [x] Added ADR-008 covering batching, same-run payload reuse, and explicit
  runtime controls.
* [x] Added a batched embedding API and environment-driven runtime settings.
* [x] Updated index persistence to batch recomputed embeddings and reuse
  identical payload vectors within one flush.
* [x] Added regression tests for batching and same-run payload reuse.
* [x] Added a benchmark script for phase timings and embedding batch metrics.
* [x] Ran the full validation surface:
  `black --check src scripts tests`,
  `ruff check src scripts tests`,
  `mypy src scripts tests`,
  `pytest -q`.
* [x] Captured one instrumented full-index benchmark on this repository. The
  first sample showed `embed_texts` and `flush_embedding_rows` dominating wall
  time, which confirmed the optimization target.
* [x] Ran controlled embedding microbenchmarks after the first pass. On this
  host, constrained Torch threads and larger batches sometimes helped on the
  synthetic benchmark.
* [x] Kept runtime tuning operator-controlled after follow-up end-to-end
  measurements proved too noisy to justify hardcoded thread defaults in this
  branch.
* [x] Recovered the historical large-repository baseline for
  `Personalia/Progetti/Software/texlive-2026-source` under `codira 1.4.0`.
  The timed `codira index --full` run started at `21:30:18` on 02/04/2026
  and ended at `05:31:21` on 03/04/2026, for a total wall time of
  `8h01m03s`, with:
  `Indexed: 7933`,
  `Reused: 0`,
  `Deleted: 0`,
  `Failed: 0`,
  `Embeddings recomputed: 43732`,
  `Embeddings reused: 0`,
  `Coverage issues: 0`.
* [x] Captured a large-repository full-index benchmark on
  `Personalia/Progetti/Software/texlive-2026-source` after the 1.7.x
  performance and audit-policy updates. On 03/04/2026 the command
  `codira index --full` ran from `17:27:36` to `17:40:21`, for a total wall
  time of `12m45s`, with:
  `Indexed: 7933`,
  `Reused: 0`,
  `Deleted: 0`,
  `Failed: 0`,
  `Embeddings recomputed: 43732`,
  `Embeddings reused: 0`,
  `Coverage issues: 0`.
* [x] Recorded an apples-to-apples before/after comparison for the same large
  repository and the same full-index workload:
  `8h01m03s` on `codira 1.4.0` versus `12m45s` on the current 1.7.x line,
  which is roughly a `37.7x` speedup by wall clock.
* [x] Create the final branch commit.
