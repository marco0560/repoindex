# Query Pipeline

The current query surface is exposed through `src/codira/cli.py` and backed
by two query families:

- exact lookups in `src/codira/query/exact.py`
- embedding-assisted retrieval in `src/codira/semantic/search.py` and
  `src/codira/query/context.py`

## Exact Query Flow

Exact commands such as `symbol`, `calls`, `refs`, and `audit`:

1. normalize optional repo-root-relative prefix filters
2. delegate exact lookup work to the active index backend
3. execute deterministic backend-backed retrieval against indexed artifacts
4. emit stable human or JSON output

Phase 7 moves these exact lookup surfaces behind backend methods instead of
having `query/exact.py` own raw SQLite connection setup and SQL execution.

## Context Retrieval Flow

`ctx` combines:

- exact-symbol matches
- docstring issue matches
- bounded graph evidence from static references, call edges, and include edges
- embedding-ranked candidates

The current retrieval stack merges these channels into a deterministic context
report for either human-readable, JSON, or prompt-oriented output.

The embedding channel now depends on persisted real vectors built during
explicit indexing rather than a placeholder local hash projection. Explain
output also reports the active embedding backend metadata so retrieval
diagnostics can be tied to a concrete backend contract.

Phase 17 adds an explicit retrieval planner in
`src/codira/query/classifier.py`. The planner classifies each query into a
deterministic primary intent family:

- behavior or implementation
- test or validation
- configuration
- API surface
- architecture or navigation

The resulting retrieval plan now owns:

- channel routing order
- explain-mode planner diagnostics
- whether docstring issue enrichment should run
- whether include-graph expansion should run
- whether cross-reference collection should run

The current `ctx` implementation uses call-graph, callable-reference,
and include-graph data twice but in bounded forms:

- as low-weight retrieval-time evidence that can support ranking
- as bounded post-merge expansion around the current top matches

The current capability-driven retrieval path also owns shared retrieval
producer metadata in `src/codira/query/producers.py`.

That layer now declares:

- stable producer identity
- producer and capability versions
- retrieval capability sets for channel and enrichment producers

The query core consumes those descriptors generically. It does not require
built-in analyzers to implement retrieval capabilities directly, and it must
not depend on analyzer internals to rank evidence.

Phase 7 also moves the embedding channel behind backend methods. The semantic
wrapper in `src/codira/semantic/search.py` now delegates to the active
backend instead of owning direct SQL access to the embedding tables.

## ADR-004 Query Implication

The CLI contracts remain unchanged, but exact-query and embedding-query paths
now depend on backend methods rather than raw SQLite access. Later phases can
build registries and alternate backends against that seam instead of patching
query modules directly.

Phase 8 completes the backend-selection side of that boundary by routing query
entry points through `codira.registry.active_index_backend()`.

Phases 12 through 17 complete the ranking and retrieval side by adding:

- deterministic file-role classification
- evidence-based merge diagnostics
- diversity-aware result selection
- query-usable include-graph expansion for C
- language-specific semantic text units
- planner-driven retrieval routing

The corresponding indexing-side requirement is now explicit as well:

- analyzers emit durable symbol identities
- changed files preserve unchanged symbol embeddings when their semantic
  payload hash still matches
- query-time semantic work reads persisted vectors only
