# Architecture

This section documents the current `codira` architecture and the accepted
migration boundary introduced by
[`ADR-004`](../adr/ADR-004-pluggable-backends-migration-plan.md).

The current implementation remains:

- registry-driven
- SQLite-backed
- mixed-language across Python and C-family analyzers
- CLI-driven through a single repository-local index

These documents describe the post-Phase-9 architecture produced by the
`ADR-004` migration branch.
