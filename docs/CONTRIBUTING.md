# Contributing

## Source of truth

The repository filesystem is the source of truth. Do not assume structures,
modules, or workflows that are not present in the repo.

## Validation

Run the standard local validation loop before concluding a change:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
black --check src scripts tests
ruff check src scripts tests
mypy src scripts tests
pytest -q
```

Use the repository-local `.venv` for all Python-facing tools.

## Bootstrap

A fresh clone can be initialized with:

```bash
python3 scripts/bootstrap_dev_environment.py
```

That bootstrap flow creates `.venv`, installs development and documentation
dependencies, installs the repository-local first-party package set, and
installs repo-local Git configuration.

## Release discipline

Before pushing release-bearing changes to `main`, run:

```bash
git release-audit
```

The local release contract is documented in `docs/release/checklist.md` and
`docs/release/process.md`.

## Branching and decisions

Repository branch and ADR workflow guidance is documented in:

- `docs/process/branching.md`
- `docs/process/decisions.md`

## Context exploration

Before broad patching work:

```bash
codira ctx "<query>" --json
```

Use `rg` first when you need to verify candidate symbols or files.

## Architectural work

ADR-driven architecture changes should be linked to the corresponding
documentation under `docs/adr/`.

The accepted migration direction for pluggable backends and analyzers is
documented in `ADR-004` and is now the implemented branch architecture.

When architecture changes land, update all three surfaces together:

- `docs/architecture/` for the stable current-state description
- `docs/adr/` for durable decision and migration records
- `README.md` when user-facing capability or workflow descriptions change

For analyzer or scanner changes, validate behavior against a real Git-backed
repository when practical, not only against synthetic fixtures.
